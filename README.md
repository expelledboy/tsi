> Typescript projects made easy.

## Rational

Some popular tools in the Typescript ecosystem have almost become standards.

What would it look like if we combined them all into a single tool?

## Usage

```sh
tsi init
tsi test
tsi build
tsi start
```

## Best Practices

- `tsc` ~ Building Typescript code.
- `git` ~ Version control.
- `pnpm` ~ Package management.
- `semver` ~ Package versioning.
- `ts-node` ~ Running Typescript code.
- `jest` ~ Testing.
- `eslint` ~ Linting.
- `prettier` ~ Formatting.
- `husky` ~ Git hooks.
- `lint-staged` ~ Run linters on staged files.
- `turborepo` ~ Package caching.
